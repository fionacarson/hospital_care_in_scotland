## Brief description of dashboard topic
Our dashboard is based on NHS Scotland data. Our brief was to investigate to what extent the 'winter crises' reported in the media are real and determine how Covid has affected acute care in Scotland. 

The dashboard outlines our topic in terms of a journey through the hospital system from admission, to treatment and then finally discharge. 

Our dashboard contains a front page summary, followed by a further tabs which cover admission, treatment and discharge. 


## Stages of the project
A large amount of background reading was conducted at the start of the project to help from the questions in the brief. Crises in the NHS is topical at the moment and there are a large number of media reports available. 

The data links provided in the brief were investigated and other data was also sourced from the Public Health Scotland website. This stage of the project involved high level analysis such as determining what variables were in the data and what time periods the data was collected over.

The git folder structure was set up and the repository shared. 

Once the data was better understood we discussed the key datasets that would help answer the brief. These key datasets were divided among team members and then analysed in detail to determine trends in time and by geography, age and deprivation. 

Planning the structure of the dashboard was conducted on pen and paper. Once this was agreed, a more detailed dashboard outline was created and shared through Miro. 

Cleaning and wrangling the data was a time consuming task, which was followed by preparing suitable graphs. A graph theme, colour palette and graph plotting function were created to simply the visualisation step and ensure our plots were consistent.

The outline of an R Shiny app was created and then populated according the original plan.

It was difficult to visualise the contents of our front page summary tab at the start of the project so this was designed and built after the rest of the app was working.

The app was extensively tested to ensure it worked as it should and all data was displayed as expected. 

Finally the documentation was completed and a presentation prepared.
