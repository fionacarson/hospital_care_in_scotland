1) Response times weekly from 25th October 2021 broken down by HB
2) Number of callouts weekly from Jan 2020 - broken down by age, sex, HB etc. 
3) Yearly figures for purple response times < 6 min and 90th percentile < 15 min for 2017/18 up to 21/22 (not sure why it is divided across 2 years each time)
